# xastir-sounds
Audio alert sound files for Xastir.

The "sounds" subdirectory here should be copied to the Xastir share
directory into which other Xastir data has been installed.  This
depends on your system, but may be /usr/share/xastir,
/usr/local/share/xastir, or some other variant depending on how you
built the code.

Xastir will look in <share directory>/sounds for any sound files it
needs to play for its audio alerts feature (enabled under
File->Configure->Audio Alerts).
